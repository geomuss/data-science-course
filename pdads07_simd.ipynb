    "#### Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "[The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation](https://www.gov.scot/collections/scottish-index-of-multiple-deprivation-2020/?utm_source=redirect&utm_medium=shorturl&utm_campaign=simd) is a relative measure of deprivation across 6,976 small areas (called data zones). If an area is identified as ‘deprived’, this can relate to people having a low income but it can also mean fewer resources or opportunities. SIMD looks at the extent to which an area is deprived across seven domains: income, employment, education, health, access to services, crime and housing.\n",
    "\n",
    "SIMD is the Scottish Government's standard approach to identify areas of multiple deprivation in Scotland. It can help improve understanding about the outcomes and circumstances of people living in the most deprived areas in Scotland. It can also allow effective targeting of policies and funding where the aim is to wholly or partly tackle or take account of area concentrations of multiple deprivation. have a look at this [comic](https://www.gov.scot/publications/simd-illustrated-story-a-place-in-time/) about the Levenmouth area in Fife.\n",
    "\n",
    "SIMD ranks data zones from most deprived (ranked 1) to least deprived (ranked 6,976). People using SIMD will often focus on the data zones below a certain rank, for example, the 5%, 10%, 15% or 20% most deprived data zones in Scotland. There are some good [visualisations and insights](https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-index-multiple-deprivation-2020/pages/5/) available to us already.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will make use of the open data provided by the Scottish government for analysis, this should be a skills integration task and should also be a useful exercise in working with a much larger data set. As in previous notebooks we shall make use of data science libraries such as `pandas` to aid our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before beginning, have a look at this [interactive map](https://simd.scot/#/simd2020/BTTTFTT/9/-4.0000/55.9000/) that has been set up, this is a good way to represent the data and make it accessible to the public.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data file for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the csv file from Moodle and import into pandas, create a new dataframe with the file. Before beginning read the summary of each of the columns in the datafile. The following notes are provided with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "* SIMD 2020 was published on 28 January 2020.\n",
    "* A revision was published in April 2020 due to an error in the income ranks provided by DWP. \n",
    "* There was some impact on the overall SIMD ranks, however these changes were not substantive on the whole. \n",
    "* A summary of the impact can be found on the SIMD website.\n",
    "* For more information, guidance and technical notes please go to [www.gov.scot/SIMD](www.gov.scot/SIMD).\n",
