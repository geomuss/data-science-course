    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This data can then be used throughout your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naming variables is known as one of the most difficult tasks in computer programming. When you are naming variables, think hard about the names. Try your best to make sure that the name you assign your variable is accurately descriptive and understandable to another reader. Sometimes that other reader is yourself when you revisit a program that you wrote months or even years earlier. Think of the variable as a box in the computer memory that you can store things in and also label.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python a variable is created using the assignment operator `=` the name of the variable is specified followed by the value you want to set. Because the equals sign `=` is reserved for variable assignment, to use an equals you type `==`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variable Assignment Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "` my_variable = 3 `\n",
    "\n",
    "` my_second_variable = 4 `\n",
    "\n",
    "` my_third_variable = “hello” `\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, data type is an important concept. All variables have a data type, python is a dynamically typed language - which means you can change the type of a variable. Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will look at the following Python data types that are built-in to the language by default, in these categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Strings - these are strings of characters, single characters or even full sentences, you set a variable to be a string by enclosing it in quotes the string is abbreviated to `str` in python:\n",
    "\n",
    "` x = \"Hello World\"\tstr\t`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Numbers are called integers and python abbreviates this to `int`, to create an integer just type the variable name then a number:\n",
    "\n",
    "` x = 20\tint\t`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Another numeric type is a float. This is a number with a decimal point, americans call the decimal point a floating point so this is where that name comes from.\n",
    "\n",
    "` x = 20.5\tfloat `\n",
    "\n",
    "* A final numeric type is a boolean, this is a type that is either true or false python writes these as True or False:\n",
    "\n",
    "` x = True\tbool `\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Checking data types with the type function\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to determine the type of an object in python, we can use the `type()` function, we need to nest a value inside the parenthesis, this will pass it to the fucntion that preceeds it.\n",
    "\n",
    "` my_variable = 5 `\n",
    "\n",
    "`type(my_variable)`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Run the examples in the following cells to see these concepts in action"
