    "\n",
    "Correlation means association - more precisely it is a measure of the extent to which two variables are related. There are three possible results of a correlational study: a positive correlation, a negative correlation, and no correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Correlation is not causation\" just because two variables are related, it does not necessarily mean that one causes the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr Saul McLeod [explains](https://www.simplypsychology.org/correlation.html) in simple terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "A <b>positive correlation</b> is a relationship between two variables in which both variables move in the same direction. Therefore, when one variable increases as the other variable increases, or one variable decreases while the other decreases. An example of positive correlation would be height and weight. Taller people tend to be heavier.\n",
    "\n",
    "A <b>negative correlation</b> is a relationship between two variables in which an increase in one variable is associated with a decrease in the other. An example of negative correlation would be height above sea level and temperature. As you climb the mountain (increase in height) it gets colder (decrease in temperature).\n",
    "\n",
    "A <b>zero correlation</b> exists when there is no relationship between two variables. For example there is no relationship between the amount of tea drunk and level of intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pearson's correlation coefficient is the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "One way to quantify the relationship between two variables is to use the Pearson correlation coefficient, which is a measure of the linear association between two variables. It always takes on a value between -1 and 1 where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* -1 indicates a perfectly negative linear correlation between two variables\n",
    "* 0 indicates no linear correlation between two variables\n",
    "* 1 indicates a perfectly positive linear correlation between two variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to calculate this in python we can use the `numpy` library, first step is to install it:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install numpy`\n",
    "\n",
    "By convention numpy is imported as `np`"
