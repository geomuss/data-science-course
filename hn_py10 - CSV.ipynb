    "## Introduction to CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes in programming we will want to extract data from a source, this could be from word documents or from text files, or perhaps the data could be downloaded from a web API. A common format for transferring data is comma separated value (CSV). CSV files are standardised in [RFC 4180](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180). The UK government have [some guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-csv-file-format#when-not-to-use-csv-files) on how and when to use CSV files. \n",
    "\n",
    "CSV files contain rows and columns of data. The columns are delimited by a character which is usually but not always a comma. You can get space, or even tab delimited files, for example on a unix-like operating system the `/etc/passwd` file is colon delimited. Meaning that the fields in each row are separated by the `:` character.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of what a raw CSV might look like, often the first row can be used as the header, or the column names:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line\n",
    "       break (CRLF).  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "       `aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF`\n",
    "       \n",
    "       `zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF`\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line\n",
    "       break.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "       `aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF`\n",
    "       \n",
    "       `zzz,yyy,xxx`\n",
    "\n",
    "### CSVs and Python\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a standardised format then it should be easy for python to work with these files, firs download the `simple.csv` file from Moodle, it is very small CSV file we can use for learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to do is get the path to the CSV file right so we can tell python where it is, if you are using JupyterLab or JupyterHub, press CTRL + B to open the file explorer on the left hand side of the window. Then drag `simple.csv` into the file explorer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we can use the `os` module to check if the file exists. Run the code in the next cell once you have the file downloaded."
