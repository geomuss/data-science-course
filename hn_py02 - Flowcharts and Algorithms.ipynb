    "### Stepwise Refinement\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the oldest methods still used today in computer programming is\n",
    "Stepwise refinement. Stepwise refinement refers to the progressive\n",
    "refinement in small steps of a program specification into a program.\n",
    "Sometimes, it is called top-down design. The term stepwise refinement\n",
    "was used first in the paper titled Program Development by Stepwise\n",
    "Refinement by Niklaus Wirth, the author of the programming language\n",
    "Pascal and other major contributions to software design and software\n",
    "engineering, in the Communications of the ACM, Vol. 14 (4), 1971, pp.\n",
    "221-227.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wirth said, \"It is here considered as a sequence of design decisions\n",
    "concerning the decomposition of tasks into subtasks and of data into\n",
    "data structures.\" We use the term to describe the development of a\n",
    "method from its specification. We will see small steps, like breaking a\n",
    "high-level statement into a sequence of statements. Consider the\n",
    "following two examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1\\. Changing time formats\n",
    "\n",
    "Translating a time of day from 24-hour format into conventional AM-PM\n",
    "format. Two stages of stepwise refinement are used: firstly you need to\n",
    "decide if the time is AM or PM, so is the number greater than 12? This\n",
    "breaks the problem into two parts, the AM part should be easy now you\n",
    "just add the AM to the end of the time and drop the zero, so 09:00\n",
    "becomes 9am, 0815 becomes 8:15am and so on. The next step is to convert\n",
    "the 24-hour times to 12-hour times, this can be achieved by taking 12\n",
    "away from the first number so 13-12 = 1, that's 1pm, 18 -12 is 6, that's\n",
    "6pm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2\\. Anglicising an number\n",
    "\n",
    "Anglicise means to adapt (a foreign word, name, or phrase) to English\n",
    "usage. According to the dictionary, the first known use of the word was\n",
    "in 1710. Stepwise refinement could be used to develop a method to\n",
    "anglicise numbers ---to turn integers like 1710 into words: one thousand\n",
    "seven hundred and ten. It's amazing how stepwise refinement results in a\n",
    "simple method, and the development incorporates recursion in a natural\n",
    "way. We would have to take each column in the system and convert it to\n",
    "words, then put them together, so 1 thousand, 7 hundreds, and 1 tens\n",
    "would convert to one thousand seven hundred and ten.\n",
    "\n",
    "A top-down approach (also known as stepwise design) is essentially the\n",
    "breaking down of a system to gain insight into the subsystems that make\n",
    "it up. In a top-down approach an overview of the system is formulated,\n",
    "specifying but not detailing any first-level subsystems. Each subsystem\n",
    "is then refined in yet greater detail, sometimes in many additional\n",
    "subsystem levels, until the entire specification is reduced to base\n",
    "elements. Once these base elements are recognised then we can build\n",
    "these as computer modules. Once they are built we can put them together,\n",
    "making the entire system from these individual components.\n",
    "\n",
    "To show you an example of Top-Down design we'll take the act of making\n",
    "pancakes. Starting from the top we have the task to ***Make pancakes.***\n",
    "Saying that by itself isn't enough to actually make any pancakes, we\n",
    "need to break the task down:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Make some pancakes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Organise Kitchen\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make Pancakes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Serve\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Each of these tasks can then be broken down further:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Organise Kitchen\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clean surfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get out mixing bowl, whisk, spoon, sieve\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get out plain flour, salt, eggs, milk, butter\n",
    "\n",
    "* Put on apron\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make Pancakes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sift salt and flour into bowl\n",
    "\n",
    "* Break eggs into bowl\n",
    "\n",
    "* Whisk\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add water and milk\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add butter\n",
    "\n",
    "* Whisk\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cook\n",
    "\n",
    "* Serve\n",
    "\n",
    "#### And each of these tasks can be broken down further, let us take a look at steps in the cooking task:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get pan to temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pour batter in\n",
    "\n",
    "* Spread batter to edges\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use plastic spatula to check bottom of pancake\n",
    "\n",
    "* When brown, flip\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use plastic spatula to check bottom of pancake\n",
    "\n",
    "* When brown finish\n",
    "\n",
    "We can break down some of these tasks even further. So starting at a single point, the creation of a pancake, we have broken down the whole process into a series of individual tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithmic Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest methods for guessing a number is called ***exhaustive enumeration.*** Let's say we want to find a value and the value is 10, using exhaustive enumeration we guess 1 and then check if this is 10, if not we add 1 and then check again. Eventually we will get to the right answer. This works just fine for a small number but let's say we had to guess 100 or 1,000,000 - this would take a much longer time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you think of a more efficient way to find a number? In topic 1 we learned about the guess and check method - of course you could take a\n",
    "guess. Let's say we guess the right number first time - then of course that is more efficient than exhaustive enumeration - but what if the\n",
    "guess was always wrong? It could take forever to find the right number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method of guessing a number is called the ***bi-section method***, sometimes called bisection-search or interval halving. This\n",
    "is a simple form of the bisection method. The rules are to guess a value of 10 are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the endpoint-values (highest and lowest) 1 and 10 and then we divide the highest value by 2 and then round up if the answer is 0.5 or\n",
    "higher. This should give an answer of five.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we check if 5 is the right answer or if it is too high or too low, 5 is too low so we take the guess and add it to the endpoint which gives\n",
    "us 15, then divide that by two. 5 + 10 = 15 then 15 / 2 is 7.5 - round 7.5 up to 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "We check if 8 is right and find it's too low so repeat the process 10+8 = 18 divided by 2 gives 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still too low so add 10 to 9 and divide by two gives 9.5 round up and you have 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this method we got the answer is 4 steps compared to 10 steps in\n",
    "exhaustive enumeration? At the moment this may seem trivial however if\n",

    "# Part 2 Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax can be defined as the set of rules or principles that govern the\n",
    "structure of well formed sentences in a language. A sentence like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Today I went to visit a friend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is a syntactically valid sentence, if i were to send you a message with\n",
    "this sentence and wrote it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "^oday & 12nt t9 vi6it “ friend\n",
    "\n",
    "You would probably reply and say - what do you mean? That is because\n",
    "this sentence violates the syntactic rules of the English language,\n",
    "there is no such word as ^oday & 12nt. In computer programming, the\n",
    "computer only understands instructions if they are written in a way that\n",
    "the computer can read. In python to print out a word to the screen we\n",
    "write it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`\\>\\>\\> print (“Hello World”)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will return:\n",
    "\n",
    "`\\>\\>\\> Hello World`\n",
    "\n",
    "The computer prints it out because you have given it a syntactically\n",
    "valid instruction. If you miss out one of the quotation marks or forget\n",
    "to close a bracket or mis-spell the word print, the computer will return\n",
    "a syntax error - examples of incorrect print statements include:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Print (“Hello World”) - print should be in lowercase`\n",
    "\n",
    "`print (“Hello World” - missing the closing parenthesis`\n",
    "\n",
    "`print (Hello World”) - missing the opening double quotation marks`\n",
    "\n",
    "`pirnt (“Hello World”) - the word print is misspelled`\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors are usually easy for the computer to spot and also are\n",
    "quite easy to fix, its common to make a spelling mistake or miss out a\n",
    "bracket and these kind of errors are easily resolved\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Semantic Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "A semantic error is different from a syntax error, in such that the\n",
    "instruction can be syntactically valid and so the computer tries to\n",
    "interpret this, however the outcome generates something that is\n",
    "unexpected. Consider the sentence again:\n",
    "\n",
    "Today I went to visit a friend.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a syntactically and semantically valid sentence but let's say we\n",
    "changed it to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Today visit went I to friend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this does not break any English syntax laws, so the words are valid\n",
    "words - however they do not make sense in the order that we have\n",
    "supplied them. Semantic errors are more difficult for the computer to\n",
    "spot because often the instructions are valid. Consider the following\n",
    "sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"John is a married bachelor.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This is grammatically well formed but expresses a meaning that cannot be\n",
    "true, how can John be a bachelor and also be married?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax and Semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "Just because something is semantically valid in one language - this\n",
    "doesn't mean it is valid in another. If i asked you to print (“Hello”)\n",
    "you would say - what do you mean print, do you want me to go to the\n",
    "printer and print out a piece of paper with the word hello on it? If you\n",
    "went to a local coffee shop and said “Je voudrais un café” unless the\n",
    "person spoke French they would say something like \"sorry what was that?\" What you said\n",
    "was syntactically and semantically valid in French, but not in English."
