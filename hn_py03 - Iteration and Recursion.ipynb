    "### Exhaustive Enumeration - Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration is working through a problem one step at a time, **exhaustive enumeration** is an iterative method of performing a calculation. If we\n",
    "want to add together two numbers 3 and 4. I know we know the answer is seven but how did we find that - ok we just know because it's simple\n",
    "arithmetic - an iterative method of doing this would be decrementing 3 by one until we read 0 and for each decrement incrementing 4 by 1. The\n",
    "steps would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3 + 4 is the same as\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2 + 5 is the same as\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1 + 6 is the same as\n",
    "\n",
    "* 0 + 7 - which is the answer as we cant add anymore\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully that makes sense - that is iteration, we slowly refine the problem ***one step at a time*** and each step is the same size. The\n",

    "### Bi-Section Search - Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "A more efficient method of searching for a number is by halving the interval between guesses, let's say I asked you to pick a number between\n",
    "one and 10 you would likely say 5. Once I had a student who said 0, but that is a story for another day. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's say i told you that number was too high you would probably half the guess and say 2 or maybe 3. You already know how to do this but often it is good to put names to techniques and there is a name for this, it is called ***bisection search***.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bisection method is a ***recursive*** method, we take a value and use it to ***generate another value*** lets find 20 with the bisection\n",
    "method, taking 10 as the first guess.\n",

    "### Revision to help with this weeks practical tasks: **Heron's Method of Finding the Square Root**\n",
    "\n",
    "Heron of Alexandria, who lived in ancient Egypt in around the first century AD, devised a method for calculating the square root of numbers,\n",
    "now sometimes it doesn't give the exact answer but most of the time it gets a ***good-enough*** guess that it is almost the exact value. First\n",
    "we set a target to find the square root of - 36, now we know that the square root of 36 is 6 because 6\\*6 is 36 but using heron's method we\n",
